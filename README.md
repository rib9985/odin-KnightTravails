# Knight Travails
## A Breadth First Search implementation in Javascript, using ES6 modules
- Using BFS, the function `knightMoves(initialPos, finalPos)` outputs resulting moves of the shortest path from the initial position to final position
- Implementation uses a queue and a Set to mark visited nodes
- Queue stores the next current position while checking if the position was already visited

## Testing
 - Clone the repo
 - Make sure node.js is installed at at least version 20.11.00
 - Within the repo directory, run `node knightTest.mjs`
